	<p>hello! I'm lannabann, although I go by many aliases (see <a href="about.html">about</a>)</p>
	<p><strong>I'm 14</strong> and also <strong>trans</strong>, I don't label my sexuality anymore, if you don't
		respect that then fuck off &lt;3 </p>
	<p>I've been using linux since the age of <strong>12</strong>(ish, can't remember exactly), and have been making
		random stuff
		since the age of <strong>11</strong> (9 if you count scratch)</p>
	<p>I'm currently using <strong>rust</strong> and have been trying on and off to get better at
		<strong>drawing</strong>, start learning <strong>linear algebra</strong>, and get into <strong>graphics
			programming</strong> (although have been having difficulties since it's generally (by generally,
		I mean I'm going off of <a href="https://youtu.be/O-2viBhLTqI?t=1316">one acerola video</a>)
		recommended you instead use an already existing engine, mostly unity, but unity has shitass support for
		any code editor/IDE other than vs code and visual studio, and if you don't wanna use an engine your only
		other option is a graphics API or library, and while rust is <em>capable</em> of graphics programming,
		pretty much all of your options are either just openGL wrappers (glium), or severely lack any sort of
		tutorials (miniquad), so far the only exception I've seen is wgpu, which takes inspiration from vulkan
		and isn't beginner friendly)
	</p>
	<p>((speaking of miniquad, I find it very funny that most responses on reddit are just people saying "just use
		macroquad instead"))</p>
	<p>this is <strong>not</strong> an exhaustive list of my interests, if you want to find more information about
		me, I recommend you go to the respective links below</p>
